# Epic Partners test task
Swagger Spring Boot App (a test task  for Epic Partners)

### Summary:
- I used OpenAPI Generator (via maven) to generate server-side API interface and data classes. I wanted this part to be 100% autogenerated, but there was initially a problem: I used Swagger Generator, and it didn't want to add @Entity annotations. After some exploring I switched to OpenAPI Generator and found out how to use x-class-extra-annotation and x-field-extra-annotation (hello useSpringJpa: true).
- Created a dummy Controller class so that I could test my API.
- Added MySQL and Liquibase for db initialization.
- Created a Repository and made my Controller a functioning class.
- Added additional rest points to add/list counters, for the interactive page.
- Created an index.html for the app description and another page for the visual counter controls, to make it 2 pages.
- Added Bootstrap for the looks, some JS to make buttons work.
- Added db population in liquibase.
- Added Docker configuration for MySQL and the app itself, so it should be starting now with "docker-compose up"
